# algo-vision
Easily visualize and practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Starting with dynamic programming, we also support bit manipulation, binary search, and more. Blind 75 problems are coming soon.

## Quick Start
Visit [algo-lens](https://jaroslaw-weber.github.io/algo-lens/) to explore algorithm visualizations.

## Whatâ€™s Inside
- **Dynamic Programming**: See step-by-step visualizations to understand how solutions are built.
- **Bit Manipulation and Binary Search**: Visualize and practice these techniques.
- **Interactive Tools**: Experiment with algorithms to learn how they work.
- **More to Come**: New algorithms are added regularly.
