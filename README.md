# algo-vision
Easily visualize and practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Starting with dynamic programming, we also support bit manipulation, binary search, and more.

## How to use
2025-04-17 : Working on separating code to frontend and backend to develop service.
To run it on local:

add .env file in the /frontend/ folder:

```
BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

go to /backend/ folder and run 

```
bun run dev
```

Then go to /frontend/ folder and run:

```
npm run dev
```

Now, open the frontend url and it should work :)

I will work on better UX

## Whatâ€™s Inside
- **Dynamic Programming**: See step-by-step visualizations to understand how solutions are built.
- **Bit Manipulation and Binary Search**: Visualize and practice these techniques.
- **Interactive Tools**: Experiment with algorithms to learn how they work.
- **More to Come**: New algorithms are added regularly.
