# algo-vision
Easily visualize and practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Starting with dynamic programming, we also support bit manipulation, binary search, and more.

## Huge refactor in progress

Some things may not work when running it on local env so please use the Quick Start (go to https://algolens.dev/).

## Quick start

Just go to https://algolens.dev/ to start using it!

## Project Structure

This repository uses a monorepo structure managed by npm workspaces:

- `packages/frontend`: The main web application built with Astro.
- `packages/backend`: The Node.js backend API.
- `packages/landing-page`: The simple landing page built with Astro.
- `packages/algo-lens-core`: Core logic shared between packages (potential future use).

## How to run on local

1.  **Environment Setup:**
    - Add a `.env` file in the `packages/frontend/` folder with the following content:
      ```
      BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:4005"
      ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    - Run `bun i` in the root directory. This will install dependencies for all workspaces.

3.  **Run Development Servers:**
    - Run the following command in the root directory:
      ```
      bun run dev
      ```
    - This command uses `concurrently` to start the development servers for the frontend, backend, and landing page simultaneously.

4.  **Access the applications:**
    - Frontend application: Typically runs on `http://localhost:4321` (check console output).
    - Backend API: Typically runs on `http://localhost:30004005` (check console output).
    - Landing page: Typically runs on a different port (check console output, often `http://localhost:4322`).

## Whatâ€™s Inside
- **Dynamic Programming**: See step-by-step visualizations to understand how solutions are built.
- **Bit Manipulation and Binary Search**: Visualize and practice these techniques.
- **Interactive Tools**: Experiment with algorithms to learn how they work.
- **More to Come**: New algorithms are added regularly.
