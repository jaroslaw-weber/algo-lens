## Approach

The problem of traversing a matrix in spiral order can be solved by maintaining four boundary pointers: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`. We iterate through the matrix in a clockwise spiral, shrinking the boundaries after each traversal direction.

The algorithm proceeds in four main steps within a loop:

1.  **Traverse Right:** Iterate from `left` to `right` along the `top` row, adding elements to the result array. After this, increment `top` to exclude the traversed row.
2.  **Traverse Down:** Iterate from `top` to `bottom` along the `rightmost` column, adding elements to the result array. After this, decrement `right` to exclude the traversed column.
3.  **Traverse Left:** Iterate from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row, adding elements to the result array. This step is performed only if `top <= bottom` (to handle cases where only a single row remains). After this, decrement `bottom` to exclude the traversed row.
4.  **Traverse Up:** Iterate from `bottom` to `top` along the `leftmost` column, adding elements to the result array. This step is performed only if `left <= right` (to handle cases where only a single column remains). After this, increment `left` to exclude the traversed column.

The loop continues as long as `top <= bottom` and `left <= right`. These conditions ensure that we do not over-traverse or process elements already visited.

## Data Structures

-   **Array (`result`):** Used to store the elements of the matrix in spiral order.

## Complexity

-   **Time Complexity: O(m * n)**
    Each element in the `m x n` matrix is visited exactly once. Therefore, the time complexity is directly proportional to the total number of elements in the matrix.

-   **Space Complexity: O(1)**
    The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for the boundary pointers (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) and the `result` array. The space used by the `result` array is `O(m * n)` to store the output, but this is generally not counted as auxiliary space for the algorithm itself, as it's required for the output. If the output array space is considered, then the space complexity would be O(m * n).
