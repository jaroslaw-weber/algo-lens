## Approach: Sliding Window with Two Hash Maps

This problem can be efficiently solved using the sliding window technique combined with two hash maps. One hash map (`tCharCount`) will store the frequency of characters in the target string `t`, and the other (`windowCharCount`) will keep track of the character frequencies within the current sliding window in string `s`.

The core idea is to expand the window to the right until it contains all characters from `t` (including duplicates), and then shrink the window from the left to find the smallest valid window.

### Steps:

1.  **Initialize Character Counts for `t`**:
    Create a hash map, `tCharCount`, to store the frequency of each character in string `t`. This map represents the characters we *need* to find in our window.

2.  **Initialize Sliding Window Variables**:
    -   `windowStart`: Pointer for the left boundary of the sliding window, initialized to 0.
    -   `minLen`: Stores the length of the smallest valid window found so far, initialized to infinity.
    -   `minWindow`: Stores the actual smallest valid window substring, initialized to an empty string.
    -   `matchedChars`: A counter to keep track of how many characters in `t` (with duplicates) are currently matched in our window. This is crucial for knowing when a window is "valid".

3.  **Expand the Window (Right Pointer `windowEnd`)**:
    Iterate with `windowEnd` from the beginning of `s` to its end.
    -   For each character `char` at `s[windowEnd]`:
        -   If `char` is in `tCharCount`:
            -   Increment its count in `windowCharCount`.
            -   If `windowCharCount[char]` is less than or equal to `tCharCount[char]`, it means we have successfully matched one more required character from `t`. Increment `matchedChars`.

4.  **Shrink the Window (Left Pointer `windowStart`)**:
    Once `matchedChars` equals the total number of characters in `t` (i.e., `t.length`), it means the current window is valid. Now, try to shrink the window from the left to find the minimum possible valid window.
    -   While the window is valid (`matchedChars === t.length`):
        -   Calculate the current window length (`windowEnd - windowStart + 1`).
        -   If this length is smaller than `minLen`, update `minLen` and `minWindow`.
        -   Consider the character `leftChar` at `s[windowStart]`:
            -   If `leftChar` is in `tCharCount`:
                -   If `windowCharCount[leftChar]` is equal to `tCharCount[leftChar]`, it means removing this character will make the window invalid (we lose a required match). Decrement `matchedChars`.
            -   Decrement `windowCharCount[leftChar]`.
        -   Move `windowStart` to the right (`windowStart++`).

5.  **Return Result**:
    After iterating through all characters in `s`, `minWindow` will hold the smallest valid substring. Return `minWindow`.

### Data Structures:

-   **Hash Maps (`tCharCount`, `windowCharCount`)**: Used to efficiently store and retrieve character frequencies. This allows for O(1) average time complexity for character lookups and updates.

### Complexity:

-   **Time Complexity**: O(m + n), where `m` is the length of `s` and `n` is the length of `t`.
    -   Initializing `tCharCount` takes O(n).
    -   The `windowEnd` pointer iterates through `s` once (O(m)).
    -   The `windowStart` pointer also iterates through `s` at most once (O(m)).
    -   Hash map operations (insert, delete, lookup) take O(1) on average.
    -   Therefore, the total time complexity is O(m + n).
-   **Space Complexity**: O(k), where `k` is the number of unique characters in `t`. In the worst case, `k` can be 52 (for all uppercase and lowercase English letters). This is due to the space used by the two hash maps.
