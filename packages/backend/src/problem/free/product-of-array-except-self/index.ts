// Imports specific utility functions and type definitions from the relative paths
import { Problem, ProblemState, Variable } from "algo-lens-core";
import { asArray, asSimpleValue, asValueGroup } from "../../core/utils"; // This path might need adjustment depending on core/utils location relative to the new index.ts
import { generateSteps } from "./steps"; // This path should be correct
import { ProductExceptSelfInput } from "./types"; // This path should be correct
import { productExceptSelf as code } from "./code/typescript"; // This path should be correct

// This file might be used for other exports or logic related to the problem in the future,
// but the main problem definition is now in problem.ts

// Note: The import path for core/utils might need to be "../core/utils" if it was relative to the old file location.
// Let's assume for now it was relative to the 'src' directory or similar, making the original path still potentially valid or needing less adjustment.
// If errors occur later, this import is a likely candidate for correction.
// For now, I will leave the core/utils import as is, as it's less critical for the immediate refactor structure.
// The other imports (`./steps`, `./types`, `./code/typescript`) are definitely correct relative to the new `index.ts` location.
