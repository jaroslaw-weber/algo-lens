# Description Guidelines

A well-written problem description is essential for clarity and user engagement. Follow these guidelines to ensure your algorithmic problem descriptions are effective and easy to understand.

---

## 1. Purpose

To provide a clear, concise, and complete statement of the algorithmic problem, enabling users to quickly grasp what is being asked.

---

## 2. Structure

A good problem description should include:

- **Problem Statement:**  
  Clearly and succinctly state what the user is required to solve. Avoid ambiguity.

- **Examples:**  
  Provide at least one input/output example, with a brief explanation of how the output is derived.

- **Constraints:**  
  List any constraints (e.g., input size, value ranges, time/space limits) that affect the solution.

- **Edge Cases:**  
  Mention any special or tricky cases that users should consider.

- **Language:**  
  Use simple, direct language. Avoid jargon and overly complex sentences.

## 3. Example Template

```
## Problem

Given an array of integers, return the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.

## Example

Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]  
Output: 6  
Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

## Constraints

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

## Edge Cases

- All numbers are negative.
- The array contains only one element.
```

---

## 4. Best Practices

- Be as specific as possible in the problem statement.
- Use consistent formatting for examples and constraints.
- Explain examples clearly, especially if the logic is not obvious.
- Anticipate and mention edge cases to guide users.

---

## 5. Common Mistakes

- Leaving out constraints or edge cases.
- Using vague or ambiguous language.
- Providing examples without explanations.
- Making the description too long or too short.

By following these guidelines, you will help users understand the problem quickly and avoid common sources of confusion.
