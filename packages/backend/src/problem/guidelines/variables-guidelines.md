# Variables Guidelines

Clear and concise descriptions for variables are essential for understanding the algorithm's state during visualization. Follow these best practices when writing descriptions in `variables.ts`:

1.  **State the Purpose:** Briefly explain what the variable is used for in the algorithm.
2.  **Describe the Content:** If the variable is a data structure (like an array, hashmap, or queue), describe what kind of data it holds and how it is organized.
3.  **Explain Keys and Values (for hashmaps/objects):** If the variable is a hashmap or object, clearly state what the keys represent and what the corresponding values represent.
4.  **Use Simple Language:** Avoid overly technical jargon. The descriptions should be understandable to someone learning the algorithm.
5.  **Be Specific:** Instead of generic terms, use terms relevant to the problem (e.g., "course" instead of "node", "prerequisite" instead of "dependency").
