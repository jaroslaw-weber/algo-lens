# Explanation Guidelines

A strong explanation helps users understand the reasoning and approach behind a solution. Use these guidelines to write clear, educational, and insightful explanations.

---

## 1. Purpose

To explain the logic, approach, and reasoning behind the provided solution, making it accessible to users of varying backgrounds.

---

## 2. Structure

A good explanation should include:

- **High-Level Overview:**  
  Start with a summary of the approach before diving into details.

- **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**  
  Divide the solution into logical steps. Explain what happens at each stage and why.

- **Data Structures & Algorithms:**  
  Clearly state which data structures and algorithms are used, and why they are appropriate.

- **Pseudocode or Diagrams (Optional):**  
  Use pseudocode, diagrams, or visual aids if they help clarify the logic.

- **Complexity Analysis:**  
  Briefly discuss time and space complexity, and any trade-offs.

## 3. Example Template

```
## Approach

We use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently.

1. **Initialization:**  
   Create a dp array where dp[i] represents the answer for input i.

2. **Recurrence:**  
   For each i, compute dp[i] based on previous results.

3. **Result:**  
   Return dp[n] as the final answer.

## Data Structures

- Array for dynamic programming state.

## Complexity

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)
```

## 4. Best Practices

- Use clear, simple language.
- Explain the "why" behind each step, not just the "how."
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity.
- Include diagrams or pseudocode for complex logic.
- Relate the explanation to the problem statement and examples.

---

## 5. Common Mistakes

- Jumping into details without an overview.
- Failing to explain why a particular approach or data structure is used.
- Omitting complexity analysis.
- Using jargon or overly technical language without explanation.

By following these guidelines, you will help users understand not just what the solution does, but why it works and how to apply similar reasoning to other problems.
