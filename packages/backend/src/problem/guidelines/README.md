## Core Guidelines

These guidelines cover fundamental aspects of problem definition and visualization:

- [**Steps Guidelines**](./steps-guidelines.md): Comprehensive guide for writing algorithm steps and comments for visualization in `steps.ts`, including `StepLoggerV2` usage, examples, and best practices.
- [**Variables Guidelines**](./variables-guidelines.md): Best practices for describing and managing variables in `variables.ts`, crucial for accurate visualization.
- [**Common Issues and Troubleshooting**](./common-issues-guidelines.md): A guide to common errors and their solutions encountered during problem creation and fixing.

## Problem Folder File Guidelines

This section provides links to detailed guidelines for the various files found within each problem folder (e.g., `packages/backend/src/problem/free/3sum/`). Each file plays a specific role in defining and supporting a problem.

- [**Description Guidelines**](./description-guidelines.md): Guidelines for crafting clear, concise, and complete problem descriptions in `description.md`, including structure, examples, and constraints.
- [**Explanation Guidelines**](./explanation-guidelines.md): Guidelines for writing insightful explanations of solution logic and approach in `explanation.md`, covering structure, complexity, and best practices.
- [**Groups Guidelines**](./groups-guidelines.md): Guidelines for defining logical groupings of test cases in `groups.ts`, enhancing test organization and coverage.
- [**Index Test Guidelines**](./index-test-guidelines.md): Guidelines for writing comprehensive and well-structured unit tests in `index.test.ts`, ensuring solution correctness.
- [**Problem Guidelines**](./problem-guidelines.md): Guidelines for defining the problem's core structure and function signature in `problem.ts`, including type annotations and JSDoc.
- [**Testcase Guidelines**](./testcase-guidelines.md): Guidelines for defining diverse and effective test cases in `testcase.ts`, critical for thorough problem validation.
- [**Types Guidelines**](./types-guidelines.md): Guidelines for defining custom types and interfaces in `types.ts`, ensuring type safety and clarity.
- [**Code Guidelines**](./code-guidelines.md): General guidelines for code implementation files within the `code/` directory, promoting consistent coding standards.
- [**Podcast Script Guidelines**](./podcast-script-guidelines.md): Guidelines for writing engaging podcast scripts in `podcast_script.md` (if applicable).
