# Unique Paths Description

There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.
