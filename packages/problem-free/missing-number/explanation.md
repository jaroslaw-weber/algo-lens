## Approach: Summation

We can find the missing number by utilizing the property that the input array contains all numbers from 0 to n except for one missing number. We can calculate the expected sum of numbers from 0 to n and subtract the actual sum of the numbers present in the input array. The difference will be the missing number.

1.  **Calculate Expected Sum:** The expected sum of numbers from 0 to n can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `expectedSum = n * (n + 1) / 2`, where `n` is the number of elements in the input array (which is also the largest number in the complete sequence).
2.  **Calculate Actual Sum:** Iterate through the input array `nums` and calculate the sum of all the numbers present in it.
3.  **Find Missing Number:** Subtract the `actualSum` from the `expectedSum`. The result will be the missing number.

## Data Structures

-   Array: The input is an array of numbers.

## Complexity

-   Time: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the input array. We iterate through the array once to calculate the actual sum.
-   Space: O(1), as we only use a few extra variables to store the sums.
