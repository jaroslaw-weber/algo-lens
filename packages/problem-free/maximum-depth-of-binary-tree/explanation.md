## Approach

We use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to find the maximum depth of a binary tree. BFS explores the tree level by level, and the maximum depth is the number of levels.

1.  **Initialization:** If the root is null, the depth is 0. Otherwise, initialize a queue with the root node and its depth (1). Initialize `maxDepth` to 1.
2.  **Level Order Traversal:** While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and its depth.
3.  **Update Maximum Depth:** Update `maxDepth` with the current node's depth if it's greater.
4.  **Enqueue Children:** If the current node has a left child, enqueue it with an incremented depth (`depth + 1`). If the current node has a right child, enqueue it with an incremented depth (`depth + 1`).
5.  **Result:** After the BFS traversal is complete, `maxDepth` will hold the maximum depth of the tree.

## Data Structures

-   Queue: Used to manage the nodes to visit in a level-by-level manner.

## Complexity

-   Time: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node once.
-   Space: O(W), where W is the maximum width of the tree. In the worst case (a complete binary tree), this can be O(N).
