# Palindromic Substrings Problem Explanation

## 1. Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the number of palindromic substrings in it. A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

## 2. Initial Thoughts: Brute Force

A straightforward approach is to generate all possible substrings and then check if each substring is a palindrome.

```
count = 0
for i from 0 to n-1:
  for j from i to n-1:
    substring = s[i...j]
    if isPalindrome(substring):
      count++
return count
```

The `isPalindrome` function would take O(k) time for a substring of length k. Generating all substrings takes O(n^2) time. So, the total time complexity would be O(n^3), which is inefficient for larger strings.

## 3. Core Idea: Expand Around Centers

A more efficient approach leverages the property of palindromes: they expand symmetrically from their center. A palindrome can have either an odd length (centered around a single character) or an even length (centered around two adjacent characters).

We can iterate through all possible "centers" of palindromes and expand outwards to find all palindromes centered at that point.

For a string of length `n`, there are `2n - 1` possible centers:
- `n` single characters (for odd-length palindromes)
- `n - 1` spaces between characters (for even-length palindromes)

For each center:
1. Initialize `left` and `right` pointers to the center(s).
2. While `left` is valid and `right` is valid and `s[left] == s[right]`:
   a. Increment palindrome count.
   b. Decrement `left` and increment `right`.

## 4. Algorithm Steps

1. Initialize `count = 0`.
2. Iterate `i` from `0` to `s.length - 1` (representing the center of the palindrome).
3. For each `i`, consider two cases for expanding around centers:
   a. **Odd length palindromes:** `left = i`, `right = i`. Call a helper function `expandAroundCenter(s, left, right, count)`.
   b. **Even length palindromes:** `left = i`, `right = i + 1`. Call a helper function `expandAroundCenter(s, left, right, count)`.

4. The `expandAroundCenter` helper function:
   a. Takes `s`, `left`, `right`, and `currentCount` as input.
   b. While `left >= 0` and `right < s.length` and `s[left] === s[right]`:
      i. Increment `currentCount`.
      ii. Decrement `left`.
      iii. Increment `right`.
   c. Return the updated `currentCount`.

5. The final `count` will be the total number of palindromic substrings.

## 5. Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n^2).
    *   We iterate through `2n - 1` possible centers.
    *   For each center, in the worst case, we expand outwards up to `n/2` times.
    *   Therefore, the total time complexity is approximately `(2n - 1) * n/2`, which simplifies to O(n^2).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1).
    *   We only use a few variables to store pointers and the count, so the space complexity is constant.

## 6. Code Snippet (TypeScript)

```typescript
export function countSubstrings(s: string): number {
  let count = 0;
  const n = s.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // Odd length palindromes (center is s[i])
    count += expandAroundCenter(s, i, i);

    // Even length palindromes (center is s[i] and s[i+1])
    count += expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1);
  }

  return count;
}

function expandAroundCenter(s: string, left: number, right: number): number {
  let currentCount = 0;
  while (left >= 0 && right < s.length && s[left] === s[right]) {
    currentCount++;
    left--;
    right++;
  }
  return currentCount;
}
