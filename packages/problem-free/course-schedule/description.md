# Course Schedule Description

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you must take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.
