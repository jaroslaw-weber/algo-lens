# Changelog

## [Unreleased] - 2025-06-10

### Changed
- Changed `l.simple` to `l.arrayV3` for logging the `strs` variable in `group-anagrams/steps.ts` to correctly visualize it as an array.
- Added descriptive labels to variables in `product-of-array-except-self/variables.ts` for improved visualization.
- Shortened variable names in `product-of-array-except-self/steps.ts` and updated corresponding names in `variables.ts` for brevity.
- Improved test cases for 3Sum problem to ensure minimum input array length of 7.
- Added highlighting to the result array when pushing elements in the Spiral Matrix problem.
- Reduced the number of test cases for the Spiral Matrix problem to 5, with each matrix being 5x5 or larger.
- Modified Spiral Matrix problem steps to only show 4 out-of-bounds pointers instead of all out-of-bounds and boundary pointers.
- Removed interval visualization and used the new `l.string` method in `longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/steps.ts`.
- Updated test cases for 'longest-substring-without-repeating-characters' to have input strings between 8 and 15 characters long.
- Improved highlighting colors in the steps visualization for 'longest-substring-without-repeating-characters' problem.
- Updated pointer labels to "left" and "right" in the steps visualization for 'longest-substring-without-repeating-characters' problem.
- Renamed variables 'i' and 'j' to 'left' and 'right' in 'longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/steps.ts' for improved readability.
- Added highlighting for repeated characters in the steps visualization for 'longest-substring-without-repeating-characters' problem.
